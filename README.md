# Strategic Decision Analysis for Accelerating Prepaid Subscriber Growth

## Overview

This project evaluates strategic options for accelerating the growth of prepaid gross subscriber additions over a three-year period. The analysis involves a detailed comparison of two primary strategies and includes a monthly discounted cash flow analysis, leading to a key decision point at the 19th month.

> **Disclaimer:** All data used in this analysis are simulated for illustrative purposes.

## Objectives

The primary objective of this analysis is to determine the most financially viable strategy for scaling prepaid subscriber growth within a competitive market. Two strategic options were considered:
1. **Partnering with a Leading Retail Chain** (approximately 2,000 locations)
2. **Building Directly Owned Stores** (up to 1,500 stores over 8 months)

Each option was evaluated based on its impact on subscriber acquisition, operating costs, and overall profitability.

## Key Metrics

The analysis focused on the following key metrics:

- **Prepaid Average Revenue Per User (ARPU):** 
  - Partner: $25 
  - Directly Owned Stores: $28
- **Monthly Churn Rate:** 
  - Partner: 3.34% (Q2’18)
  - Directly Owned Stores: 3%
- **Commission Structures and Revenue Sharing:** 
  - Partner: $95 commission per sale + 20% share of revenue generated
  - Directly Owned Stores: $10 commission per sale + $30,000 annually for salaries and benefits
- **Fixed Costs:** 
  - Directly Owned Stores: $40,000 average rent per store + $10,000 for fixtures

## Strategic Options Overview

### 1. Partner with a Leading Retail Chain
- **Advantages:** 
  - Wide distribution network
  - Lower upfront capital expenditure
  - Shared risks with the partner
- **Disadvantages:** 
  - Higher commission per sale
  - Revenue sharing agreement
  - Lower control over customer experience
- **Performance:** 
  - Expected monthly sales of 38 units per store, with potential variations of ±10 units

### 2. Build Directly Owned Stores
- **Advantages:** 
  - Greater control over customer experience
  - Higher ARPU
  - No revenue-sharing agreements
- **Disadvantages:** 
  - Higher upfront capital expenditure
  - Operational risks borne by the company
- **Performance:** 
  - Expected monthly sales of 50 units per store, with potential variations of ±10 units

## Key Findings

Through the analysis, it was determined that the **breakeven point** between the two strategies occurs at the **19th month**. Up until the 19th month, the partner-based strategy is more profitable due to lower upfront costs and the benefit of a large distribution network. However, beyond the 19th month, the **direct store ownership strategy** begins to outperform the partner-based approach in terms of profit margin.



## Conclusion

For short-term gains and quick market penetration, the partner-based strategy is advantageous. However, for long-term profitability and control, investing in directly owned stores is the superior strategy. The breakeven point identified at the 19th month serves as a critical decision-making milestone.
